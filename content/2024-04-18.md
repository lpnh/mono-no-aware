So it came. Finally. The dark, bold horizon arrived, fulfilling the firmament.

Lights from scattered thunders, there, here, revealing fleeting fragments of
clouds.
Then the water. Deep, once rising from the earth. And deep, now refusing the
skies.

A bonding feeling. Being water for days long, to contemplate everything
becoming water as well. Dissolving. With each drop flowing. Unbounding. Being.
One.
